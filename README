This is the README file for Allie Robbins' Digital Image Assignment 4

All files were written in C++, referencing OpenCV 3.4.1.

List of Files included in program:
  - program1
  - program2
  - program3
  - program4
  - program5
  - program6
  - makefile
  - README
  - structuringElement.txt

To execute the program:
    Run command "make" to build/compile the programs.

To run a program:
    program 1 → run command "./add_rm_noise imageFile n"
        - imageFile is the input image
        - n is the percentage of bits to flip

    program 2 → run command "./zoom -z # -R # -C # -H # -W # imageFile outputFile"
        - z is the zoom factor
        - R is the center X value
        - C is the center Y value
        - H is the height of the input image
        - W is the width of the input image
        - imageFile is the input image
        - outputFile is the name of the output file

    program 3 → run command "./sm_filter imageFile"
        - imageFile is the input image

    program 4 → run command "./blur imageFile # #"
        - imageFile is the input image
        - the two # values are the size and resolution

    program 5 → run command "./program5 imageFile"
        - imageFile is the input image

    program 6 → run command "./program6 imageFile"
        - imageFile is the input image

To clean the object files:
    Run command "make clean".

Purpose of the assignment / program(s):
    The purpose of this assignment is perform image enhancements in Spatial Domain.

    Program 1 adds Gaussian noise into an image.

    Program 2 allows users to zoom into a selected area of an image w/ a specified zoom factor.

    Program 3 applies a smoothing spatial filter with standard averaging to an image.

    Program 4 applies a circular kernel of specified size and resolution to blur an image.

    Program 5 blurs the borders of an image by making them pastel.

    Program 6 implements the morphological operators erosion and dilation to a binary image.
